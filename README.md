# Statistics.h

Just a small and simple statistics library i made for C/C++;
This lib was made for learning and fun purposes.
Fell free to use if you want !.

# How to use

0. ensure dependencies: \*GNU Make and GCC(Other compilers may work also,
   but you need to change the Makefile)
1. git clone/download this repo
2. type `make`
3. copy the libstatistics.a file to your project/global compiler path
4. copy the statistics.h file to your project/global compiler path
5. have fun! :3

\*OBS: you doesn't "need" Make to use the lib, all you need is a compiler
and the libc, you can just compile and archive the lib yourself if you want :),
Make is just to make the life easier
